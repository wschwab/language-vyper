# language-vyper package

This is an attempt to port an attempt to extend [MagicPython](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython/blob/master/grammars/MagicPython.tmLanguage) to Vyper on VSCode (https://github.com/p-/vscode-vyper) to Atom. Use at your own risk. (It might be worthwhile for me to mention that I've never quite done this before.)

This package is not currently the language-vyper package in APM's registry (though I'm looking into how I might do that), so if you'd like to use it, you need to install it locally. Don't worry! It's not so hard. Here are the instructions:

>     1. clone the repo locally
> 
>     2. in Atom, go to the Packages menu, and click on 'Package Generator'
> 
>     3. select the 'language-vyper' folder you just cloned
> 
>     4. restart Atom (it won't load the package until the next time it runs, so you won't be able to use it until you restart Atom)
