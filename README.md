# language-vyper package

This is an attempt to port an attempt to extend [MagicPython](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython/blob/master/grammars/MagicPython.tmLanguage) to Vyper on VSCode (https://github.com/p-/vscode-vyper) to Atom. Use at your own risk. (It might be worthwhile for me to mention that I've never quite done this before.)

### Sep 2019
Updated and extended package to reflect the curernt state of Vyper
